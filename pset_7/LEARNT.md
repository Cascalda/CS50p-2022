# [Regular Expressions](pset_7)

## [NUMB3RS](numb3rs/numb3rs.py)

- Using `re` library to do *regular expressions*, or *regex* for short.
- Using `re.VERBOSE` to help better visualise which part of the *regex* meant.

## [Watch on YouTube](watch/watch.py)

- Using *capturing groups* to group and extract relevant info via *regex*.

## [Working 9 to 5](working/working.py)

- Using ** to unpack keyword arguments for functions.
- Not using walrus, as it actually made it less readable this time.
- Breaking down a big *regex* problem into 2 *regexes*, for improved readability and modularity.
- Using `.fullmatch()` for higher accuracy instead of `.search()`.

## [Regular, um, Expressions](um/um.py)

- Using `.findall()` to find all occurrences of a particular string.

## [Response Validation](response/response.py)

- Using `validators` library to do the heavy lifting of validating email formats.
